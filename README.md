**Family Tree Visualization using LanceDB**

This project demonstrates how LanceDB can be used as a lightweight database layer to store structured relationship data and visualize it as a family tree graph using Python.

The project integrates LanceDB + Pandas + NetworkX + Matplotlib to model parent–child and spouse relationships and render them visually.



**Features**

- Stores family relationship data in LanceDB

- Models relationships using graph structures

- Visualizes family trees using NetworkX

- Clear and structured layout with Matplotlib

- Demonstrates how databases and graph theory can work together
